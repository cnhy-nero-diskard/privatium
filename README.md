# Privatium

Privatium is a personal journal web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It is designed as a private alternative to apps like Diaro, giving you full control over your data. This project is **not** intended to be a multi-user application; it is strictly for personal use, ensuring your entries remain private and under your control.

## Key Features

- Personal journal app, not multi-user
- Full control and ownership of your data
- You can setup your own database service storage of choice. Default: Supabase.
- Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase
